    ],
    "correctAnswer": "<ul>\n<li>If the loss function is flat (e.g. zero-one loss), then the gradient will be zero because changing the weights a small amount has no impact on the loss.</li>\n<li> In classification with a logistic output nonlinearity and squared error loss, the output derivative is small when the prediction is very wrong. Hence, the gradient will also be small.</li>\n<li>If the hard threshold activation function is used, the gradient will be zero because making a small change to the weights won’t change the predictions (and hence won’t change the cost).</li>\n<li> If the input z to the ReLU activation function is 0, then we have z = 0, and hence the weights that feed into this unit have zero gradient. If this happens for every training example (i.e. this unit is dead), then these weights will have zero gradient and won’t get updated.</li>\n<li>Similarly, if a logistic unit is saturated, the derivatives for the incoming weights will be very small.</li>\n</ul>",

    "correctAnswer": "Samples can be labeled using multi-hot encoding, e.g. \\( (1, 0, 0, 1) \\) will be simultaneously class 1 and class 4.<br/> Using softmax activation with cross-entropy loss is problematic because it unfairly penalizes examples with many labels. In the extreme case, if the example belongs to all classes and the model correctly predicts \\( \\langle \\frac{1}{n_y}, ... ,\\frac{1}{n_y} \\rangle\\), then the CE-loss becomes \\( -\\sum_{i=1}^{n_y}\\text{log}\\hat y_i = n_y\\text{log}n_y \\), which will be far bigger than the loss for most-single class examples.<br/>\nInstead, we can formulate this as \\(n_y\\) independent logistic regression tasks, each trying to predict whether the example belongs to the corresponding class or not.
